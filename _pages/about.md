<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a 4th year PhD student in the VLC (Vision, Learning and Control) group, University of Southampton. My study and research are mainly focused on 3D object detection problems with images and point cloud data. I obtained my bachelor degree in mathematics and now I am keep improving my skills in coding and research. 

My research interest includes: 3D Computer Vision, Cross-domain 3D Object Detection, 3D Visual Grounding.
