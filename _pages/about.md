<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a 4th year PhD student in the VLC (Vision, Learning and Control) group, University of Southampton, supervised by [Xiaohao Cai](https://xiaohaocai.netlify.app). My study and research are mainly focused on 3D object detection problems with images and point cloud data. I obtained my Master degree at the University of Southampton in 2021. Before that, I obtained my bachelor degree in Mathematics in 2020. 

My research interest includes: 3D Computer Vision, Cross-domain 3D Object Detection, 3D Visual Grounding.

I am currently looking for postdoc and industrial opportunities in Uinted Kingdom / China.
